    <h2>Netflix, Register</h2>

    <h4>Use your React skills to improve your existing projects.</h4>

    <h1>Netflix App</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a new Registration Component mounted on a new route /register and
        a button in the navbar to get there.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this Registration Component, create a Controlled Form with:
        <ul>
          <li>Name - Required, at least 2 chars</li>
          <li>Surname - Required, at least 3 chars</li>
          <li>Email - Required - Should be an email field</li>
          <li>
            Password - Required - Should contain at least 8 chars, 1 digit, 1
            letter
          </li>
          <li>Year of Birth - Required - from 1910+</li>
          <li>Street Address - Required</li>
          <li>City - Required</li>
          <li>Postal Code - Required - Numeric 5 digits</li>
          <li>Credit card - XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (EXTRA)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        All the messages / errors should be displayed properly on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        The submit button from the form should be "ENABLED" only when the form
        is validated and when each input's constraints are fulfilled. When
        clicked it should display a recap of the information submitted (you can
        choose between mounting a component for it dynamically in the same route
        or redirecting the user to a new route).
      </li>
      <li>[EXTRA] Transform the "AddComment" form into a Controlled one.</li>
    </ol>
